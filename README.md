# e-puck2 cliff autocharge
This is an example showing how to use the [cliff sensor extension](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=Others_Extensions#Cliff_sensor) in order to let the robot autonomously charge istelf by following a black line that leads to the charging station.

Have a look at the [cliff sensor video section](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=Others_Extensions#Videos) to see the robot in action.

For information on how to build the project refer to the [e-puck2 wiki](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2_robot_side_development#Project_template).
